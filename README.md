# Python Coding Projects

While studying python at the Tech Academy, I completed a number of drills and challenges. This file contains the code for a few of these assignments that I completed.

The projects here involve creating a GUI to help a user acheive a certain task on their PC.
* [Select File](GUI%20select_directory): Basic GUI that allows user to select a directory on their computer.
* [Browse and Check Files](GUI%20browse_check_files): Allows user to see check for files on their computer.
* [Move Text Files](GUI%20move_txt_files): Allows user to select all of a type of file from one directory and move them to another directory of their choosing.
* [Phone Book App](project_phonebook): The final project here allows a user to create and manage a list of contacts and their information via a GUI
